## Unite DeFi Vision (as presented by 1inch)

_This section paraphrases key points from [1inch’s Unite DeFi presentation](https://www.youtube.com/live/DKQJlzJuTqQ?si=XLGWLG04MFpl2c7R&t=1827)._

**TL;DR: Unite DeFi Vision aims to create a unified DeFi experience that abstracts away blockchain complexity, allowing users to focus purely on their financial goals across all chains through intent-based architecture and seamless chain interoperability.**

### Core Principles

- **Unified Liquidity Layer**: Transform fragmented pools into a single, efficient market
- **Chain Abstraction**: Make blockchain infrastructure invisible for the end user
- **Intent-Based Architecture**: Focus on user outcomes, not technical processes

### UX Revolution

**Today's Reality vs. Tomorrow's Experience:**

- Switch networks manually → One interface, all chains
- Manage gas on multiple chains → No gas token management
- Navigate different UIs → Instant execution
- Worry about bridge security → No security concerns
- Wait for confirmation → Guaranteed settlement
- Deal with failed transactions → Focus on outcomes only
- Lose money on MEV → No worry about MEV

**Chain Abstraction as key to mass adoption:**

- Simplified Onboarding: New users don't need to understand chains
- Reduced Cognitive Load: Focus on financial goals, not technical details
- Enhanced Security: No bridge risks or wrapped asset concerns
- Better Capital Efficiency: Access best rates across all ecosystems
- Future-Proof Design: New chains integrate seamlessly
- True Interoperability: Not just asset bridges, but unified experiences
